We took the shield scene from the class and made some changes :

1. Hit points- the player has 3 lifes at the beggining. In the script DestroyOnTrigger2D we added a paramemter that count the player's life and destroy the player only if it has no more lifes.

2. life- we added an object in the game that the player could take and get more life. we made an object "life" that has script "GiveMoreLife"
